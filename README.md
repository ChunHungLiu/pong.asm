# pong.asm

pong game written in assembly for i386 (32-bit) architecture.

Compiles and runs on any Linux (including 64-bit versions).

## Status

Got a moving pong ball yay \o/ -- yeah it's not much, but assembly is hard right? More to come, stay tuned.

## Installation

```sh
git clone git@github.com:thlorenz/pong.asm.git 
```

## Install Dependencies and Build

pong.asm depends on lots of library functions from [lib.asm](https://github.com/thlorenz/lib.asm).

In order to install them and build do the following:

```sh
make deps && make
```

## Code

Code is well documented to help people like me who are just starting out with assembly understand and learn from it.
